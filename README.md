# WeatherApp

A Spring Boot REST application that consumes the OpenWeatherMap API to provide current weather data based on location.

**Note:** 
* the data may not be 100% accurate, as I am using the trial version of OpenWeatherMap
* I left out my API key in ExchangeService.java --> to run, you need your own API key
